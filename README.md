Note that the track widths and layer thickness for controlled impedance was calculated with the following stack-up from JLCPCB: [JLC04161H-3313](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance), so you will need to specify this when ordering via JLC. 

Complete gerbers, drill files, BOM and CPL are also included in `/manufacturing` if you just want to order this board without checking out the design.
